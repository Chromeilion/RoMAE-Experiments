# Theoretical Validations

This experiment serves to validate some of the theory of the model.
Specifically, it investigates the ability of the model to reconstruct exact 
positional information from the positional embeddings.
This is done by passing in a bunch of 1 values with uniformly distributed 
positions.
We then try to predict the exact positions.
